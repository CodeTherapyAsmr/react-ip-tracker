# Frontend Mentor Challenge - IP Address Tracker

This is my submission for the IP Address Tracker challenge from Frontend Mentor. The goal of this challenge was to build a fully functional IP address tracker and to get it looking as close to the provided design as possible. To get the IP address locations, I used the IP Geolocation API by IPify, and I generated the map using LeafletJS.

## Challenge Requirements

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## Technologies Used

- ReactJS
- Styled Components
- LeafletJS
- IP Geolocation API by IPify

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ip-address-tracker.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
